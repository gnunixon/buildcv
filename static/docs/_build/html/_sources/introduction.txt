Introduction
============
YourCV is a system for generate and manage a large amount of CVs from a same set of datas. Let me explain.
For example I was study journalism and worked in 7 mass-media (magazines, newspapers, radio and web-sites). At the same time I am a layouter and designed a large amount of books, newspapers and brochures. And I have worked in programming (Python, web-design, web-developing and so on).
If I want to send my CV to a newspaper, the HR isn't interested in my experience of programming or layouting. So I don't need to include this informations about me in CV. Similar for case when I send a CV to web-desing company - my experience in journalism is not relevant in this case. For each case I need a different CV, but I don't want to write a new CV each time when I need to send it. 
YourCV is a tool for selecting only needed datas from your biography and generate a new CV. You eaven don't need to write this datas by yourself if you already introduce it in your Facebook account - just login, and the site will collect all informations itself.
